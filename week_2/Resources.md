## 1. Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

These videos explain **what LLMs are**, how they work internally, and why they behave the way they do.

### Intro to Large Language Models (Conceptual Overview)
📺 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g  

A beginner-friendly explanation of what LLMs are, how they are trained, and why they can generate human-like text.
